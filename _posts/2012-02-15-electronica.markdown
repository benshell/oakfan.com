After a recent trip to the Disneyland Resort, I returned home with a little motivation (and a promise made to a friend) to put this new episode together. I video taped this evening at ElecTRONica during a trip last October. Since Disney has announced that they will be replacing ElecTRONica with Mad T Party later this year, I thought now was a good time to release this video with the hope that it would get people to experience ElecTRONica before it's gone.

Disney created Tron City’s ElecTRONica to replicate and improves upon its predecessor, “Glow Fest”, which was installed as a nightly party intended to be a diversion for the hordes waiting to see “World of Color”.

ElecTRONica’s centerpiece is a futuristic DJ platform painted to resemble the computer world of Tron. It’s a magnet for the teen-aged throng, and the older kids at heart, providing dancing to electronica and house music blended with top 40 hits.

A highlight of the evening’s festivities is Laserman. His electrifying performance dazzles party goers as he battles the laser’s power for supremacy. We watch as he displays masterful moves to control the wild light – all set to the groove of Daft Punk’s album, Tron Legacy: Reconfigured.

Tron City is also home to the re-created Flynn’s Video Arcade. If you have seen the movie Tron, you will recognize Flynn’s as the central location in the Tron Universe. Walt Disney Imagineering filled this 80’s-era arcade with many vintage video games such as Pole Position, Centipede, Battle Zone, Pac-Man and of course, Tron. Flynn’s Arcade truly does bring back the 80s.
