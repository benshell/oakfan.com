The Little Mermaid ~ Ariel’s Undersea Adventure opened to guests in June of 2011, at Disney California Adventure park. This whimsical underwater adventure transports you "under the sea" to visit Ariel and her friends in a musical retelling of the classic motion picture. During this immersive experience, you’ll see the Little Mermaid falling in love, getting her legs, losing her voice and winning the prince as the best-loved musical numbers bring the attraction to life all around you.

The Palace of Fine Arts rotunda, originally the entrance to the former "Golden Dreams" attraction, has been incorporated into The Little Mermaid attraction architecture and is now part of the entrance façade.

An 86-foot long, hand-painted mural greets you in the loading area of the attraction. The mural depicts many of the characters you’ll see within the attraction including Prince Eric, King Triton, Sebastian, Flounder and, of course, Ariel.

Nearly 200 Audio-Animatronics figures perform in the attraction. The Under the Sea scene alone has 128 figures, including 50 spinning starfish.
