    <font size="4"><font size="2"><p>Hello everyone, </p>

      <p>Thanks to all of the wonderful support I have received, the “Bringing Disneyland Home Video Podcast” has become one of the most popular Disney Podcasts on the Internet. As of July 2011, the show has been downloaded over an amazing 3 million times. And there is no sign of it slowing any time soon. As iPods, iPads and Smart Phones gain more features and storage along with dropping prices, more and more people will have access to this “media on the go” format. I have a long list of subjects for which I would like to create videos. I just need to find the time in my busy schedule to produce the shows. Though you don’t need an iPod or Smart Phone to watch my videos, it’s a great way to take Disneyland with you wherever you go.</p>

      <p>I thought I’d give you a little history about how my podcast got started. I discovered Disneyland podcasts for the first time back in October 2005. I really enjoyed the audio experiences included in those programs. It was just pure Disneyland you could enjoy anytime through the sounds of the park. That really got me thinking about how cool it would be to have a video version that included both the sights and sounds of Disneyland. I figured this would be a great way to show the intricate details found all around the Disneyland Resort. I know this isn’t an original concept but my goal for this podcast was to share these short video clips of Disneyland with other fans like myself on a regular basis. I figured if the subjects featured in the videos interested me, they would probably interest others as well. It seems I was right. And so the Bringing Disneyland Home Video Podcast was born. My first episode was published on December 1, 2005 and consisted on about 4 1/2 minutes of very short clips from around the park. You can watch that video in the Archives section of this website.</p>

      <p>Living so far away, I don’t get a chance to visit the Disneyland Resort too often. Back in 2001, I purchased a digital video camera before one of my trips to Anaheim. Since then, I have captured over 75 hours of video footage. I had always planned on editing the footage I took to create my own Disneyland home videos that I could watch whenever I got a little homesick for the Happiest Place on Earth. Well, that didn’t happen until 2005. By then, with the introduction of video podcasting, I felt that creating these short videos would not only put all that footage to good use, I could also share them with everyone and Bring Disneyland into your Home.</p>

      <p>I’m really having fun bringing a little bit of Disneyland into YOUR Home. So far your response has been amazing. I really appreciate all the feedback I’ve received from your emails, voicemails and reviews you have posted. Please keep them coming. You never know. I might follow in the footsteps of other podcasters and read some of your letters in an upcoming episode. </p>

      <p>I’m by no means a professional videographer (Far from it). I’m just a big Disneyland fan with hours and hours of Disneyland resort footage. I hope you enjoy watching the videos as much as I enjoy bringing them to you.</p><p>-Brad</p></font></font>
