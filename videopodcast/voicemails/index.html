    <h3>The Voicemail Hotline is currently unavailable. Please send me an email.</h3>

    <h3>Thank You!</h3>
    <p>Since I can't play all of the voicemails I receive on my podcast, I thought it would be a fun idea to post some of them here. I can't tell you how much I enjoy hearing from all of you. It really makes my day to open my email and see that someone has left a message. So Thank You!
    </p>

    <p>
      Many of the voicemails I receive ask me a question. As you can imagine, it's really hard for me to answer a voicemail when I don't get a return number or email. Because of this, I was thinking that this would be a really good place for me to answer your voicemail questions.

      (Oct. 14, 2007) Zack is not alone in wondering what I've been up to. Well, over the past few months, real life has forced me to put my Disney hobby on the back burner. I want to assure everyone that I have not stopped producing my show. There are still many topics and attractions that I would like to cover. I have two in the works as I type this. I hope you understand and I want to thank you for remaining patient as I get back on track. Please look for a new video very soon.</p>

      Thanks for supporting the BDH Vidcast by purchasing one of my DVDs. The money raised is used for expenses associated with bringing this show to everyone. Your purchase is a big help. Thanks!

      I love your ideas for a show. I'm going to put them on my list of video footage I need to capture on a future trip to Disneyland. I'm always looking for new ideas and yours is a good one. THANKS!

      I'm glad you are enjoying the Videos. If you haven't already, I think you should check out episode #30. It's all about New Orleans Square and includes clips from ride throughs of both Pirates of the Caribbean and The Haunted Mansion. Also, I do have plans to create videos featuring both of those attractions in more depth. Please stay tuned!

      Thanks for supporting my vidcast. I know the last few episodes have been few and far between. Real life is crazy these days. But I have no plans on stopping the show so eventually new episodes will show up on your iTunes. LOL ;-)

      I'm glad you enjoyed Buzz Lightyear. I really hope you get a chance to go to Disneyland someday. Heck, it took me almost 40 years to make it to WDW so anything is possible. Also, if you ever have any questions about getting started with your podcast, please just let me know.

      Hi Gary. Man, I wish I was able to go to any press event at Disneyland. I'm sure it was cool working the board that day for Indiana Jones!

      Thanks for the voicemail. I would love to put out a show for Space Mountain. However, I have tried on a couple occasions to tape this attraction and it's just unusable. I don't want to just have 2 minutes of black screen so the most you will see would be of the queue and shop area.

      Welcome to my Vidcast! I'm glad you found me. I have to say that "Remember" is one of my favorite shows as well. And good news, "Parade of Dreams" can be found on episode #28. ;-)
